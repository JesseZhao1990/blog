Caveats

Be careful when using Render Props with React.PureComponent
Using a render prop can negate the advantage that comes from using React.PureComponent if you create the function inside a render method. This is because the shallow prop comparison will always return false for new props, and each render in this case will generate a new value for the render prop.

For example, continuing with our <Mouse> component from above, if Mouse were to extend React.PureComponent instead of React.Component, our example would look like this:

```
class Mouse extends React.PureComponent {
  // Same implementation as above...
}

class MouseTracker extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Move the mouse around!</h1>

        {/*
          This is bad! The value of the `render` prop will
          be different on each render.
        */}
        <Mouse render={mouse => (
          <Cat mouse={mouse} />
        )}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

```


In this example, each time <MouseTracker> renders, it generates a new function as the value of the <Mouse render> prop, thus negating the effect of <Mouse> extending React.PureComponent in the first place!

To get around this problem, you can sometimes define the prop as an instance method, like so:


```
class MouseTracker extends React.Component {
  // Defined as an instance method, `this.renderTheCat` always
  // refers to *same* function when we use it in render
  renderTheCat(mouse) {
    return <Cat mouse={mouse} />;
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Move the mouse around!</h1>
        <Mouse render={this.renderTheCat} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}


```

In cases where you cannot define the prop statically (e.g. because you need to close over the componentâ€™s props and/or state) <Mouse> should extend React.Component instead.
